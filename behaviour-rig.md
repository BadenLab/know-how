## BEHAVIOUR RIG PROTOCOLS

In both protocols the following measures will be done when maintaining the source of larvae zebrafish:  

When the zebrafish larvae reach the age 3-4 dpf, paramecia (Paramecium caudatum) will be added on the same petri dish. In this way the larvae will grow surrounded with the paramecia, which will increase the likelihood of the larvae to perform the prey capture behaviour more frequently in the testing conditions starting from 6 dpf. The paramecia feed on bacteria and algae and will not harm the growing larvae in any way. The larvae are dependent on their yolk sacs until age 4-5 dpf, so they will not compete with the paramecia on fry food (which also contains algae). After the larvae reach the age 4 dpf they will be checked on daily basis to ensure that there will be enough fry food for both larvae and paramecia (in case the larvae refuse to eat the paramecia).

Paramecium count project
1.	Place individually picked 10-15 paramecia in a small (diameter 35 mm) petri dish with fish water.
2.	Add one zebrafish larva.
3.	Place the dish in the behaviour box at the bottom, on top of the piece of black cardboard.
4.	Close the behaviour box door.
5.	Turn on the wanted LED (red, green, blue or UV).
6.	Close the door and leave the fish and paramecia there for 30-40 minutes.
7.	After the experiment, carefully place the larva into a separate petri dish back into the incubator.
8.	Count the number of paramecia under the microscope.
9.	After recording:  
 a)	AB Wild type and sws1:nfsBmCherry: Add tricaine (MS222) into petri dish to cull the fish. After 30 minutes confirm culling.  

 b)	sws1:TeNT: Replace fish water in the petri dish with PBS. Add tricaine to cull the fish. After 30 minutes confirm culling. Dissect the retina out and check expression under fluorescent light.

Fish used:  
•	AB Wild type  
•	sws1:TeNT  
•	sws1:nfsBmCherry  
•	Age: 6-8 dpf  

Eye movement project
1.	Mount a zebrafish larva into agar in a small (diameter 35 mm) petri dish.
2.	After mounting add enough fish water to cover the dish.
3.	Add at least 20 paramecia to the dish.
4.	Place the dish on top of infrared (IR) light source and diffuser in the behaviour box.
5.	Turn on IR lights, make sure that the fish can be seen clearly in the camera with paramecia.
6.	Turn on UV and RED LEDs, alternating them in 2 min. intervals. Repeat light rotation for 3 times (altogether 12 minutes of video recording).
7.	After recording:  

 a)	AB Wild type and sws1:nfsBmCherry: Add tricaine (MS222) into petri dish to cull the fish. After 30 minutes confirm culling.  
 b)	sws1:TeNT: Replace fish water in the petri dish with PBS. Add tricaine to cull the fish. After 30 minutes confirm culling. Dissect the retina out and check expression under fluorescent light.

Fish used:  
•	AB Wild type  
•	sws1:TeNT  
•	sws1:nfsBmCherry  
•	All age: 6-8 dpf
