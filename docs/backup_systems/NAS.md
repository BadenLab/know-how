# Baden Lab backup / file storage backup_system

## NOTE: Other than this automated storage system, all lab members are responsible for keeping backups of their own data! Preference is given for a complete copy in an external drive (extra points if this is kept outside the lab!)

### Currently (20191126) the lab uses a NAS system from Synology.

Computers attached to setups and other measurement devices are connected to this
system. So users have the task of copying their data after the end of an Experiment
to the appropriate folder in the NAS -> normally a subfolder inside the "data folder"
in the file tree.
  - Copying your data there ensures that the automatic backing up system saves your
  data to Oceannus (a data server maintained by Sussex IT department).

  - If you copy your data elsewhere within NAS, this won't be automatically backed up!!!

- New users should contact [Andre](https://andre.github.io) for a new login and password (which will be different from
   your Sussex credentials).

- accessing the NAS from the office should be done connecting to badenstation.biochem.susx.ac.uk/root
  - this can be done by typing the above address on your web browser
  - or more conveniently by mapping a network drive, if you are using a Windows computer.
