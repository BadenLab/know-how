**Protocol 1** `from Curr Biol. 2016 Sep 12;26(17):2268-79. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2016.06.063. Epub 2016 Aug 11.`

After euthanasia, larvae were fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 3% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature, and retinas were dissected out within 1–3 days. Fixed, whole retinas were blocked in PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1–4 hr at room temperature. Tissue was incubated in primary antibody in blocking solution for 1–5 days at 4°C. After three washes in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, samples were incubated in secondary antibody solution for 1 day at 4°C, followed by nuclear or actin staining for 1 hr at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in PBS, mounted in 0.7% agarose, and coverslipped in Vectashield (Vector Labs). See Experimental Procedures for details on nuclear and actin staining, as well as on the antibodies used.

**Protocol 2** `from Curr Biol. 2018 Jul 9;28(13):2018-2032.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2018.04.075. Epub 2018 Jun 21.`

For immunohistochemistry, larvae were culled by tricaine overdose (800 mg/l) at 7-8 dpf. Whole larvae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min before being washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For the IPL structural analysis, whole fixed larvae (7-8 dpf) were incubated in permeabilisation/blocking buffer (PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 5% normal donkey serum) for at least 10 min followed by 3-5 days incubation at 4°C with primary antibodies (chicken anti-GFP (AbCam, 13970, 1:500), goat anti-ChAT (Chemicon, AB144P, 1:50), rabbit anti-PKCα (Sigma, P4334, 1:100)). Samples were rinsed three times in phosphate buffered saline with 0.5% Trion-X 100 and incubated for another day with secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342 (1:5000) for nucleus staining in permeabilisation/blocking buffer. Finally, samples were washed in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 and mounted in mounting media (VectaShield, Vector, H-1000) for fluorescent imaging. Secondary antibodies used were as follows: Donkey anti-chicken IgG CF488A conjugate (Sigma, 1:500), Donkey anti-rabbit IgG CF568 conjugate (Sigma, 1:500), Donkey anti-goat IgG DyLight650 conjugate (BETHYL, 1:200). For photoreceptors, whole eyes were dissected from the animal at 7-8 dpf and subsequent tissues were subjected to immunohistochemistry as described above. Antibodies used are, a primary antibody: zpr-1 (ZFIN, 1:50), and a secondary antibody: Donkey anti-mouse IgG DyLight649 conjugate (Jackson Immunoresearch laboratories, 1:500). Confocal images were taken on Leica TCS SP8 or Olympus FV1000 using objectives 63x (HC PL APO oil CS2, Leica), 20x (HC PL APO Dry CS2, Leica), 60x (UPLSAPO oil, Olympus) or 20x (UPLSAPO oil, Olympus) at xy: 0.1-0.07 μm/pixel, and z-step: 0.25-0.3 μm for high-resolution images and 0.7-0.5 μm/pixel, and z-step: 2 μm for low magnification images. Images were median-filtered and contrast and brightness were adjusted in Fiji (NIH).
